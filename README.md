# Combined Order Book

### Full Stack Coding Challenge

#### Instructions:
> Build a combined order book that takes the full order books from Bittrex and Poloniex for the BTC_ETH market and displays them in a way that shows combined volume at each price point.

###### Other Considerations / Requirements:
- [ ] Complete the challenge in NodeJS.
- [ ] Clearly label which is the *Ask* book and which is the *Bids* book.
- [ ] Clearly label which exchange has order volume at each price point.
- [ ] Deploy or host demo of the code running online i.e. Heroku or Firebase or AWS
- [ ] Allow user to switch to different markets (the BTC_DOGE market for example) or between trading pairs.
- [ ] Highlight if the books overlap i.e bids on Bittrex overlap with Asks on Poloniex.
- [ ] Deploy or host demo of the code running online i.e. Heroku or Firebase or AWS
- [ ]  Actively updating the combined order book based on actual (live) trades from the exchanges Unit Tests
